                <h2>Project</h2>
                <p>BenchMark is an experimental project that uses street furniture to measure the
                    dynamics of public space and understand how UNSW students, particularly women,
                    girls and gender diverse people, interact with and move seating in public space.</p>
                <p>The seats include motion enabled lighting and were designed by female UNSW
                    Industrial Design Students. Camera-vision sensors and onsite observation
                    and surveys monitor and help us understand where and how they move.</p>
                <p>This project has been funded by Transport for NSW through the Safer
                    Cities program.</p>
